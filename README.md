# Classification of Iris flowers with extended data preprocessing

Python code offering a method to efficiently classify data from the Iris set. Data preprocessing step was extended 
in comparison to the original version because of simulated faultiness of gathered data. 

Scikit-learn library was used to prepare data as well as implement and evaluate machine learning models.
